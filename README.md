`block_timestamp` - time when the block was produced;

`transactions_count` - amount of transactions in the block

`total_difficulty` - total difficulty of the chain at the current block

`extra_data` - any data that was included additionally in the block

`gas_limit` - gas limit by all of the transactions in the block

`gas_used` - total gas used in the current block

`hash` - hash of the block

`parent_hash` - hash of the parent block

`miner` - who mined/staked the block

`nonce` - nonce

`receipts_root` - the root of the state tree

`sha3_uncles` - the mechanism which Ethereum Javascript RLP encodes an empty string
